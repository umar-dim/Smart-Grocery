The first step before you press is the same: Drain the liquid from the box of tofu. Then press.\nMethod 1: (Easiest) Use a tofu-pressing machine! I spotted one of these in Torrance", "California", "at a little Japanese grocery store. You place a block of tofu in between two plates and turn a small crank to compress it. Though it will press only one block at a time—the boxes of tofu we use come four to a box—you can set it and forget it (but do it three more times if you plan on using all the tofu).\nMethod 2: (Most common) Use two similar-size plates or relatively flat surfaces. Lay out the blocks of tofu flat in a single layer on one of the plates", "and then put the second plate on top of the tofu. Press the tofu by placing at least 10 pounds of weight on top of the second plate.\nMethod 3: (Most “professional”) We still prepare the tofu this way at our restaurant", "which is", "without question", "the most efficient way to prepare larger servings. Lay baking racks/grates inside baking sheets", "then cover racks with clean (lint-free) towels or", "as we did successfully for four years", "with neatly folded aprons laid in a single layer as level and as flat as possible across the racks. Yup", "towels or aprons", "plural. Because tofu holds so much moisture", "the liquid constantly spills over", "and we’ve found very few people who just live to clean. To absorb the moisture", "and to create much less of a mess", "we started using layers of cloth.\nLay out the tofu on the covered racks in a single layer", "organized as tightly as possible.

Then lay another equal-size baking sheet + covered rack + tofu on top of that. Repeat the same steps as needed. The top layer should be a baking sheet on which you place 30 to 40 pounds of “stuff” to press down on all the layers. No matter how many layers you stack", "the tofu should flatten out only slightly", "not be completely crushed.\nProcessing the tofu is far simpler than pressing it", "though like pressing", "there are three different ways to do it. Start with a bowl or a large (22-quart) plastic container made by and known as a Cambro (if you have one of those lying around)", "and do one of the following:\nMethod 1: Use a food mill", "which is what we use. This is by far the easiest way to process tofu and get the most consistent texture (and it’s a great method for mashing anything).\nMethod 2: Use a potato masher. Just mash away", "but you’ll still need to use the third option to smash out any little lumps that the masher doesn’t", "um", "well", "mash.\nMethod 3: Mash everything with your hands.
