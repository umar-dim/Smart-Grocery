            "so I\u2019m going to give y\u2019all (I grew up in Texas",
            "so I have the liberty to use \u201cy\u2019all\u201d liberally) three pressing options. The first step before you press is the same: Drain the liquid from the box of tofu. Then press.\nMethod 1: (Easiest) Use a tofu-pressing machine! I spotted one of these in Torrance",
            "California",
            "at a little Japanese grocery store. You place a block of tofu in between two plates and turn a small crank to compress it. Though it will press only one block at a time\u2014the boxes of tofu we use come four to a box\u2014you can set it and forget it (but do it three more times if you plan on using all the tofu).\nMethod 2: (Most common) Use two similar-size plates or relatively flat surfaces. Lay out the blocks of tofu flat in a single layer on one of the plates",
            "and then put the second plate on top of the tofu. Press the tofu by placing at least 10 pounds of weight on top of the second plate.\nMethod 3: (Most \u201cprofessional\u201d) We still prepare the tofu this way at our restaurant",
            "which is",
            "without question",
            "the most efficient way to prepare larger servings. Lay baking racks/grates inside baking sheets",
            "then cover racks with clean (lint-free) towels or",
            "as we did successfully for four years",

            "towels or aprons",
            "plural. Because tofu holds so much moisture",
            "the liquid constantly spills over",
            "and we\u2019ve found very few people who just live to clean. To absorb the moisture",
            "and to create much less of a mess",
            "we started using layers of cloth.\nLay out the tofu on the covered racks in a single layer",
            "organized as tightly as possible. Make sure the tofu doesn\u2019t hang over the sides of the sheets or it won\u2019t be pressed evenly. Next",
            "lay another towel/apron on top of the layer of tofu",
            "again",
            "flat and level. Then lay another equal-size baking sheet + covered rack + tofu on top of that. Repeat the same steps as needed. The top layer should be a baking sheet on which you place 30 to 40 pounds of \u201cstuff\u201d to press down on all the layers. No matter how many layers you stack",

            "and do one of the following:\nMethod 1: Use a food mill",
            "which is what we use. This is by far the easiest way to process tofu and get the most consistent texture (and it\u2019s a great method for mashing anything).\nMethod 2: Use a potato masher. Just mash away",

            "um",
            "well",
            "mash.\nMethod 3: Mash everything with your hands. (This is the most common way.)\nProcess the tofu until it is a consistent",
            "almost pasty texture. If you go with No. 2 or No. 3",
            "make sure to smash out all lumps from the tofu or else the seasoning won\u2019t evenly distribute throughout the mix and",

            "with little bits of scallion and corn in every bite.\nNow it\u2019s ball-rolling time! Scoop out a tablespoon of the tofu mixture",
            "hand-pack it tightly into the spoon",
            "then level out the spoon with your finger. Assertively shake or scoop out the mix into your hand while mostly keeping it in one piece. Firmly clench the tofu by making a fist",

            "either with one hand or by lightly tossing the ball back and forth between both hands like you\u2019re playing catch with yourself. Lightly roll the tofu between your hands",
            "moving your hands in an alternating clockwise motion",
